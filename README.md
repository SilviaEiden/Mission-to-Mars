# Mission to Mars

## Overview

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to help Robin, a junior data scientist, with her web app by adding Mars’s all four images of its hemisphere. To do this, BeautifulSoup and Splinter was used to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images. Next, the scraped data was stored on a Mongo database, then a web application was used to display the data, and finally the design of the web app was altered to accommodate these images.

Now, Robin can use this project to showcase her interest in working for NASA. Good luck!
